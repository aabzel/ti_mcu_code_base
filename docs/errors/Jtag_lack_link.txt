Error initializing emulator:
(Error -260 @ 0x0)
An attempt to connect to the XDS110 failed.
The cause may be one or more of: no XDS110 is connected, invalid
firmware update, invalid XDS110 serial number, or faulty USB
cable. The firmware and serial number may be updated using the
xdsdfu utility found in the .../ccs_base/common/uscif/xds110
directory of your installation. View the XDS110SupportReadMe.pdf
file there for instructions.
