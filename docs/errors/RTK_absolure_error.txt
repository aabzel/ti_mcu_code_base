I used "Fixed mode" with manual base station location setting in (UBX-CFG-TMODE3 ). And fixed NNEA tracks ware in different plasec.



I did perform GNSS RTK evaluation. 
When I plotted NMEA RTK Fixed coordinate on the map I spotted several locations.
Each RTK Fixed session started in new location. The deviation bettwenn locations was up to 33 meters. But the GNSS aerial was constantly on a single location (on the carusel porimeter). 

The main issue is that RTK Fixed mode switches on constantly in new places out of real location of GNSS aerial.

Is that a normal case for Ublox ZED F9P?

Что предпринять:

Move Base radio antenna into free space
Put Rover antenna on a 10cm ground plane
Check the Sky Map on Base and Rover, ensure the signal is not blocked in any direction. 


A clear view of the sky. Not indoors, not near a window, outside with nothing around. The accuracy of the entire system depends on the ability to see as many satellites as possible.

If your antenna does not have a built in ground plane (the u-blox antenna does not) you will need to add a metal ground plate. A car’s roof will act as a ground plate as well
